# Notification Filtering Implementation

## Overview
This implementation prevents new users from receiving notifications that were created before they were added to the organization. This ensures that new users only see relevant notifications from the time they join the system.

## How It Works

### 1. User Creation Date Tracking
- All users have a `createdAt` field automatically added by Mongoose timestamps
- This field represents when the user was added to the organization

### 2. Notification Filtering Logic
The filtering is implemented in three key places:

#### A. Notification Model (`server/models/Notification.js`)
- **Method**: `getForUser(userId, user, options)`
- **Filter**: `query.createdAt = { $gte: user.createdAt }`
- **Purpose**: Filters out notifications created before the user was created

#### B. Notification Service (`server/services/notificationService.js`)
- **Methods**:
  - `getUserNotificationsWithPermissionFilter()`
  - `getUnreadCount()`
  - `getNotificationStatsWithPermissions()`
- **Filter**: `baseQuery.createdAt = { $gte: user.createdAt }`
- **Purpose**: Ensures all notification queries respect the user creation date

#### C. Notification Controller (`server/controllers/notificationController.js`)
- **Methods**: `getUserNotifications()`, `getNotificationStats()`
- **Enhancement**: Explicitly fetches user with `createdAt` field
- **Purpose**: Ensures the user object includes the creation date for filtering

### 3. Implementation Details

```javascript
// Filter out notifications created before the user was created
// This prevents new users from receiving previous notifications
if (user.createdAt) {
    query.createdAt = { $gte: user.createdAt };
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Clean User Experience**: New users don't see irrelevant historical notifications
2. **Reduced Noise**: Prevents notification overload for new team members
3. **Relevant Information**: Users only see notifications from their time in the organization
4. **Automatic**: No manual configuration required - works automatically for all new users

## Testing

A test script is provided at `server/test-notification-filter.js` to verify the implementation:

```bash
cd server
node test-notification-filter.js
```

## API Endpoints Affected

- `GET /api/notifications` - User notifications
- `GET /api/notifications/stats` - Notification statistics
- All notification-related queries now respect user creation date

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing users continue to see all notifications (no change in behavior)
- Only affects new users added after this implementation
- No database migrations required
- No changes to notification creation logic

## Technical Notes

- Uses MongoDB's `$gte` (greater than or equal) operator
- Filters are applied at the database level for performance
- Works with all notification types (role-based, permission-based, user-specific)
- Maintains existing permission and role filtering logic
